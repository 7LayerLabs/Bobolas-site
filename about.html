              <h3>The Bobola Family Story</h3>
              <p>
                From a young age, Frank Bobola dedicated himself to the restaurant industry, starting at just 13 years old as a dishwasher. Through hard work and a passion for cooking, he quickly rose to the rank of Chef.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the years, Frank worked at beloved local spots such as The Waterwheel Restaurant in Dracut, Branding Iron Steak House in Tewksbury, The Colonial Inn in Concord, and The Lakeside in Billerica, building a reputation across the Merrimack Valley and beyond.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the mid-1980s, Frank embarked on his own entrepreneurial journey, opening Big Belly Deli on Westford Street in Lowell, MA. The deli quickly became a neighborhood favorite, leading to the expansion of Bobola's Big Belly Deli & Restaurant on Gorham Street.
              </p>
              <p>
                Frank's success continued with the opening of Belly Buster Diner in Billerica, Country View Diner in Tyngsboro, Riverside Diner in Dracut, and Dylan's Diner in Chelmsford.
              </p>
              <p>
                In July 2005, Frank opened Bobola's Family Restaurant in Dracut, MA. He built it on the values of providing excellent service, offering generous portions, and making every customer feel like family.
              </p>
              <p>
                His vision expanded further with the opening of a second location on March 19, 2018, at 9 Simon Street in Nashua, NH. Although Frank passed before seeing the new location come to life, his influence and spirit continue to be felt in every aspect of Bobola's.

            <p class="logo-story__description">
              When Frank Bobola opened his first location on Westford Street in the late 80s, he transformed an old corner variety store into a charming mom and pop diner. Despite having an exceptional product, foot traffic wasn't what he hoped for. Frank knew he needed to make a change to catch people's attention.
            </p>
            <p class="logo-story__description">
              The solution came in two parts: First, he replaced the old white sign (inherited from the previous business) with a vibrant yellow one that would grab the attention of passing drivers. Then came the special touch that would become our iconic symbol - this memorable logo, lovingly drawn by his daughter Kimberly.
            </p>
            <p class="logo-story__description">
              Today, in honor of Frank's legacy and keeping with tradition, we've given our beloved mascot a fresh update while maintaining the warm, welcoming spirit that Kimberly originally captured in her artwork. It stands as a testament to our family roots and the creative spark that helped launch what would become a cherished local institution.
